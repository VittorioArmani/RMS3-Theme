<div id="price-description">
    <p>Our templates can be sold repeatedly to different customers. Non-exclusive purchase means that other people can buy the template you have chosen.</p>
    <p>If you choose 'Unique price', it guarantees that you are the last person to buy this template. After the exclusive purchase occurs the template is permanently removed from our sales directory and is never available to other customers again. Only you and people who bought the template before you will own it.</p>
    <p><strong>Note:</strong> Nevertheless, you can't redistribute or resell templates either after NON-UNIQUE or after UNIQUE purchase.</p>
