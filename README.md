## About RMS

The key characteristics of RMS are:

- White label sales. No referral links. Our affiliates do not have to send their leads to another website, their visitors never leave their site. Affiliates do not have to promote a brand that is not their own. RMS can be installed as a separate website, or as a subdomain, it can easily be integrated to look like an inseparable part of the affiliate’s main website. This is a unique solution on the affiliate market. 
- Up to 35% commission from each sale. Another feature that is unique to RMS. Even our own TemplateMonster affiliate referral links get 30% from first sale and only 10% from next sales. Themeforest gives 30% from first sale only. 
- Localisation. Everything in RMS, from the shopfront and prices to the presales chat and shopping cart can be localised. This means that local markets like Russian, Spanish, Italian etc can be conquered much easier.
[Web-studio](https://rms3.templates.com/web-studio) option. If you own a web-studio and do not want to simply sell TemplateMonster themes, but to sell websites created with them, this option is for you. With web-studio switched on the prices on the RMS shopfront are switched off, instead of the “buy” button you get “Order a website” button, which takes the customer to fill in an order form, not to the shopping cart.
